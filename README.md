# Bayesian statistics - Olivier Gimenez, July 2020

## Slides codes and data

* All material prepared in `R`.
* `R Markdown` used to write reproducible material.
* Slides available on FigShare [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12656894.v1).
* Material available via Github [there](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/Bayesian_Workshop).  

## Objectives

* Try and demystify Bayesian statistics, and what we call MCMC.
* Make the difference between Bayesian and Frequentist analyses.
* Understand the Methods section of ecological papers doing Bayesian stuff.
* Run Bayesian analyses (in Jags), safely hopefully.

## Schedule

1. Bayesian inference: Motivation and simple example.
2. The likelihood.
3. A detour to explore priors.
4. Markov chains Monte Carlo methods (MCMC).
5. Bayesian analyses in R with the Jags software.
6. Contrast ecological hypotheses with model selection.
7. Heterogeneity and multilevel models (aka mixed models).
